# Data Hazard Labels
<img src="img/data-hazard-overview.png" alt="hazard-overview" width="600"/><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 The most basic element in conducting research is data in its many forms. The methods for collecting and presenting of this data can vary greatly depending on the source and methodology which in turn can lead to problems in evaluation and conclusions. Especially the use of increasingly complex digital technologies has increased the complexity of assigning responsibility for certain outputs or decisions made by algorithms.

 These effects and outcomes can have consequences ranging from slight deviations in results to actively harmful effects for people and the environment. Thus a reflected and responsible approach to using data science is more important than ever, but since data can be abstract and nuanced this can be difficult.<br>

 To give perspective on the difficulties and problems for specific works or sources using data science the [Data Hazard Project](https://datahazards.com/index.html#) was founded. Data Hazard Labels are similar to their real world counterparts and aim to help highlight aspects that could limit the outcome or lead to problems if they are not considered carefully.  
 
 These labels are not simple true or false problems and more than a single label can be applied to a dataset or a project. Each label comes with its own set of challenges and solutions and none of these labels are strict guidelines and rules, but are meant to facilitate communication and create understanding about the problems that can happen through improper use of data science.<br>

 <br />
 **What is a data hazard label?**<br>
 A data hazard label is a warnings sign used in cases where there are dangers through wrong use of data or technology.
 <br />
 <br />
 **Why do we need hazard labels?**<br>
 Data hazard labels are a tool to help prevent harmful scenarios by giving perspectives on data or technology uses.

## Reinforces Existing Biases
<img src="img/reinforce-bias.png" alt="reinforce-bias" width="200"/><br>
 This label indicates that data, algorithms, or software could lead to unfair treatment of individuals or certain groups. There are various reasons why this hazard might arise.

 One source of bias can be the input data itself. If the data used contains biases and these are not corrected, the bias will be perpetuated. For example, if historical data reflects societal biases, algorithms trained on this data will likely replicate those biases.

 Additionally, the design of an algorithm can introduce bias. If an algorithm gives more importance to certain characteristics, it might favor some individuals or groups over others. This can happen even if the intention is not to discriminate.

 Societal biases can also infiltrate data and algorithms, reflecting and reinforcing existing stereotypes. These biases are often unintentional and unwanted, but if left unaddressed, they can have negative and unforeseen consequences. It is crucial to recognize and mitigate these biases to ensure fairness and equity in the use of data and technology.
 <br>

### Examples
 **Input data**  <br>
  In 2014, retailer Amazon started to develop an automated hiring tool using applcation data from the company itself, that were sent in over a 10 year period. As the gender imbalance was even more pronounced during that time than it is today, a vast majority of the learning data lead to the algorithm favouring male candidates.
  Whenever the algorithm found the word "woman" in an application, it automatically ranked that application lower, which in turn would worsen the bias in the future, when that data was then used again for learning.
  When the bias was discovered 4 years later in 2018, it caused a public outcry, leading the system to be scrapped (https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45809919) entirely after fixing it proved too difficult.
  
  This example shows, just how important choosing input data can be and the consequences that can happen when there are unadressed problems in that data. Not only were the ressources and time development of the tool wasted, they also worsened the already existing problem of gender imbalance in the tech sector even further.

 **Societal Bias**  <br>
 Natural Language processing data can reinforce sexist biases due to a bias in training data. This could mean that a model evaluates certain jobs such as secretary or caretaker as intrinsically linked to women.

 Such cases were [studied](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3582269.3615599) and both natural and large language models were found perpetuate stereotypes.
 Since these models are used more, great care should be taken when working with such cases and active measures taken to prevent the spread of such stereotyping.
 These examples also show how easily such consequences happen. It is unlikely that these outcomes were planned, and it shows that active measures need to be taken to avoid cases such as these. <br>

<img src="img/stereotypical-male-jobs.png" alt="reinforce-bias" width="350"/>

### Prevention
 To minimize the risk of perpetuating a bias based there are multiple strategies that can be applied when using data, software or algorithms that have the Reinforces Existing Biases label.

 **Analyzing Input data:**  <br>
 By analyzing the input data carefully and checking the whether the data origin considered diverse and representative groups, the negative impacts of a bias can be mitigated.

**Testing for biases:** <br> 
 There are multiple tests that can check for biases, which can highlight problems. Testing the algorithms performance for marginalized groups can also give insight into how the software or algorithm might impact these groups.

**Avoiding harmful tools or policies:**  <br>
 There are tools and policies (e.g. predictive policing policies) that are known to reinforce systemic biases. By intentionally excluding these tools from use in algorithms a bias might be avoided.

## Ranks or classifies people
 <img src="img/classifies-people.png" alt="classifies-people" width="200"/><br>
 This label indicates that the data is used to rank or classify people into different categories. It is crucial to use such data considerately and carefully, as it can have far-reaching consequences.

 Issues associated with this label include inaccurate classification processes, which can misrepresent individuals. There can also be oversights in the categorization of certain groups, leading to unfair treatment or exclusion. Additionally, ranking systems can be exploited, potentially causing harm or bias against specific groups.

 Therefore, it is important to ensure the accuracy and fairness of the classification and ranking systems to avoid negative impacts on individuals and groups.

### Examples
 **Wellfare risk assessment**
 In 2014 the durch tax bureau used machine learning to classify families into different risk categories to prevent fraud for child benefits. The government had problems with families fraudulently claiming child benefits and had problems dealing with the administrative demands. The decision to prevent fraud started to aid with these problems and used a variety of data, like nationality, income and historical employment.
 The classifications were insufficient, as it did not have enough room for context and put hundreds of families into high risk groups for making small administrative mistakes or giving stricter conditions based on dual citizenship. If they were flagged they had to pay back all benefits retroactively and with additional fines on short notice. These repayments mainly affected low income families, which suffered heavily under these conditions. The algorithm was not transparent for those affected and prevented them from challenging their classifications properly and the limited categorization worsened the chances of flagged families even further.
 When the disproportional treatment due to minor mistakes or miscategorization was discovered in 2019 and a european commission was put into place which found evidence of discrimination and improper data usage. 
 
 The scope of this scandal, dubbed the ["Toeslangenaffair"](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/projects/aitax/publications/toeslagen/) and following findings would cause the ruling government at the time to resign. This case shows how strong the consequences for unadressed problems can be. Most of the affected families struggled to repay the benefits and were pushed into poverty. 


 **Automated hiring systems**
 Returning to the example of the [Amazon hiring system](#examples) the system ranked people according to their qualifications for tech jobs to give suggestions on whom to hire.
 As the system was trained with flawed data, it ranked women as less viable candidates than men. This bias in classification of individuals caused unfair treatment and had a negative impact on the gender imbalance by denying qualified women to enter the tech sector in a big employer in the sector.

 

### Prevention
 **Testing for different groups** <br>
 Testing the algorithm on different groups ensures that no side effects or disproportional impact of groups due to the classification system.

 **Verify validity of classification groups** <br>
 To ensure the validity of the classification groups, experts and subject specialists should be involved in the creation of the ranking system. This ensures that different views are represented and that the categories are needed for the end goal of the algorithm or technology.

 **Transparency** <br>
 By communicating weaknesses and shortcomings of the algorithm or technology openly, trust can be built and those shortcomings addressed. Testing for weaknesses and exploitable points in the algorithm to prevent the abuse of classification that give an undue advantage or disadvantage.

 **Alternative ranking** <br>
 Its important to consider different alternative rankings and confer with experts on the most fitting system. This allows for different viewpoints which reduces the risk of miscategorizing groups.  Self-selecting can also be a good way to grade people, as this allows them to consider their own nuances and contribute instead of being put into categories without being able to influence the process at all.

## Automates decision making
 <img src="img/automates-decision-making.png" alt="automates-decision making" width="200"/>
 This hazard label is applied when an algorithm or technology replaces human decision-making. The extent and scope of this automation can vary widely, as can the associated risks. 
 These decision processes may not always be transparent or appealable, yet can have large impacts on individuals. Bugs or malfunctions can also go unnoticed for some time and cause damages.
 On the other hand they can help increase efficiency both in speed as well as number of decisions.
 It is important to evaluate both the potential benefits and risks of automation, and to consider who oversees the automation process. Since this label involves a broad range of possible impacts, it requires extensive risk assessment and thorough testing before implementation.
 Understanding who controls the automation process and ensuring this process is transparent and accountable, are key factors in managing this data hazard effectively.

### Examples

**Banking proces**<br>
 A low risk example of an automated decisionmaking process are bank transfers. Most bank transfers are carried out automatically with the system highlighting irregular transfers, which then in turn have to be evaluated by a human.
 These automated decisions have precautions in place and can show how properly implemented decisions can help while also providing adequate safety. <br>

 **COMPAS software** <br>
 The Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) software is a tool designed to asses the likelihood of re-offending of criminal inmates in the US. It is meant to support judges in their sentencing decisions on bail, parole and sentencing. It was meant to reduce biases providing a data driven viewpoint.
 The algorithm used data such as criminal history, race, age, gender, employment and education, among others. These factors were then used to create predicitons on re-offending chance, failure to appear in court or risk of violent behaviour.
 A [review](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) of COMPAS's use found that it exibited a racial bias and led to overall stronger sentencing of black defendants. It also operates as a black box system, meaning users could not retrace how the algorithm came to the conclusions it did. 
 These decisions had impacts on those it judged and might have made incorrect predicitons leading to longer sentencing, denial of parole or denial of bail. 

 This highlights some potential problems of automated decisionmaking, which need to be considered, to ensure that the process is as fair and safe as possible.
 <br />
 <br />

### Precautions for automated decision making
 **Considering necessity**<br>
 Consider carefully if the decision really needs to be automated or if it should stay a decision made by a human. For this an in depth look at the damage of potential consequences is needed. The automation can help to contribute to decisionmaking quickly and if properly considered and developed can help to consider requests far faster and more precisely than humans could.
 <br />
 <br />

 **Implementing review systems**<br>
 Create systems that allow for the inclusion of incorrect cases to improve the future output. For critical systems there should be training data that covers cases as extensively as possible before it is put to real use. Problematic cases should be inspected to find the difficulties the automated decisionmaking has and remedied. These cases can then be used in testing for the same or similar systems to improve future accuracy.
 <br />
 <br />

 **Human in the loop** <br>
 In high risk cases algorithms can give a recommendation with explanations, which are then evaluated by an expert who will then make a final decision. This can help 
 
 **Transparency**<br>
 It is important that decisions can be retraced understood by a human in a timely manner. It is important that actual users also have a chance to get at least a surface level understanding of how and why their input got placed or why it failed. This creates accountability and can allow for more intricate review of a case by a human. Transparency of the output is also very important to determine if the system is working as intended and to make potential issues addressable.

## Danger of misuse
<img src="img/misuse.png" alt="misuse" width="200"/>
 The "Danger of misuse" labels applies when algorithms or data can be outside of their intended purposes, often leading to unintended and potentially harmful consequences. Algorithms are designed with specific goals and environments in mind and when outside of these, they may produce wrong or unusable results. This misuse can be dangerous because the algorithms or data might lack the necessary safeguards or considerations for contexts they were not designed for, leading to decisions that could harm individuals or groups. 

For data the collection is one of the most important issues to consider and using data gathered for another purpose use may skew or invalidate the results outright. Thus it is important consider the context and inherant deviations in the data.


### Examples
**Cambridge Analytica**
 The political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica used data gathered from Facebook accounts and used it to build detailed user profiles to create 


**Generative AI**
 The use of generative ai in recent months has had unintended consequences. These range from misuse of data, by using data sources which had not consented to being used in harmful ways through political propaganda or personal slander using generated images. [Despite generative ai companies trying to reduce these cases, these cases are only getting worse.](https://counterhate.com/research/fake-image-factories-ii/). These cases could and should have been anticipated before the release and more time put into prevention.
 Even with more awareness being drawn to this problem, problems are not preempted, but just mitigated, when they occur. It is important to create a concept against possible misuse, especially when the control over the results are limited, onece the algorithm is rolled out.<br />


### Prevention
 **Explaining use**<br>
 Explain the exact circumsances and environments in which the technology or data is meant to be used. This ensures that use cases not within these set boundaries need to be examined seperately by their creators. It is best however to try and find limitations and applications beforehand and outlining how to prevent such cases or why this technology, algorithm or data should not be used in certain cases.
 <br />

 **Follow guidelines**<br>
 Check if there are any guidelines in your area of research. These guidelines usually draw from mulitple sources and instances in which problems arose. This can help to create a robust foundation that can prevent the data or technology from being used in unwanted ways. Just following guidelines alone might not be enough to fully prevent these cases.
 <br />

 **Check other applications**<br>
 As mentioned before, it is also important to check in which fields or other ways the technology and data might be useable or applicable. It is almost impossible to consider all possible application, but finding the most likely related fields can help to stop unwan

### Quiz

## May cause direct harm
<img src="img/direct-harm.png" alt="direct-harm" width="200"/>
 Wherever the label "May cause direct harm" is applied, special care needs to be taken when creating technology or algorithms.
 This usually applies in healthcare, public transportation or more recently with ai chatbots.

 Mistakes or wrong applications of technologies in these fields can have dangerous consequences resulting in physical or mental harm and distress to people. Technologies implemented in these areas need to be tested rigorously and extensively to keep the chance for failure as low as possible, even more so than in other fields.

 This label often appears in conjunction with other labels, as worst case scenarios due to lacking prevention measures in other cases can cause direct harm to individuals, e.g. incorret decision making of software causing mental or physical harm.

### Examples
 **Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System in Boeing 737 MAX planes**<br>
 The Boeing 737 MAX aircraft series were equipped with a Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which is a flight control system created to help prevent stalling by pitching the nose of the plane downwards when external sensors measured certain conditions.
 Pilots often did not know the system existed and when it falsely activated in two separate cases an became a major contributor to both planes crashing.
 These systems were able to cause critical changes in the planes behaviour and lives were lost because of it. These systems tests had not been extensive enough and multiple design decisions contributed to the ulitmate failure. http://avherald.com/files/ethiopian_b38m_et-avj_190310_final_report_20221226.pdf (p.201-202)
 Both plane crashes lead to harm which might have been avoided if more measures for prevention of harm had been implemented.   


 **Self driving cars**<br>
 There have been multiple instances of accidents due to software failure and overreliance on assisted driving features. In 2016 the sensors of a Tesla Model S car in florida failed to detect a white trailer against a brightly lit sky while also unable to completely asses the environment, causing the autopilot to fail to brake, crashing the car into the trailer, which resulted in the death of the driver. https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812481
 This case highlighted the problems that could shows how extreme environments need to be tested thoroughly enough to prevent unforseen consequences.<br />
 Another sensor failure occured in 2018 in Arizona, when the sensors of a self driving test-car misclassified a pedestrian which caused the car to hit the pedestrian.<br>
 While in both cases a human was ulitmately in charge of the system, they relied on the presumed safety of the cars system. These cases show that as many redundancies and preventative measures as possible should be taken to ensure that no system failure results in actual harm.


 **Diagnoses**<br>
 A medical algorithm for cancer screenings might come to an incorrect conclusion and give a false positive result, which would cause physical, mental and financial harm to an individual. The impact of a false positive have been studied (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9931091/) and the consequences should be examined carefully before any use of such an algorithm.
 Such cases do not mean that such technology should never be used, as they can have great positive impacts, however it highlights the importance of testing and finding a balance between maximizing helpfulness while minimizing harm.



### Prevention
 **Testing** <br>
 Testing in cases where direct harm can be caused needs to be extensive, cover all edge cases and extreme circumsances to prevent unexpected or mistaken behaviour. It is also important to set a margin of error to see if the technology or algorithm can be used safely enough and if it cant whether it should be used at all.

 **Human in the loop** <br>
 In some cases a human in the loop approach can be used to give an additional layer of safety. By letting a person review the results potential unwanted behaviours can be found before harm occurs and prevent it.

 **Fail-safes** <br>
 Implementing fail-safes can reduce and mitigate harm in the case of malfunciton. These fail-safes activate when unexpected or unwanted behaviours occur to stop them from causing harm. These cases need to make sure that no harm is caused by the sudden stoppage, for this case they can also send alerts to draw awareness.

## Generic Data Hazard
<img src="img/general-hazard.png" alt="generic-hazard" width="200"/>
The label is meant to create accountability by giving the creators the full responsibility of the output. It also encourages vetting the data sources and giving an extensive write-up of expectations and assumptions while addressing potential shortcomings. 

### How to apply data hazard labels?
The application of data hazard labels is not meant as an apply and be done with it concept. The labels are meant to open up discussion and help with reflection on responsible ethical use and potential consequences of data science.
Ethics in data science is a complex topic so there is no need for a group to come to a definitive conclusion on which labels do or do not apply.

The labels also allow external people to participate in discussions on the ethical impact a technology or algorithm might have which can be tough to get into otherwise. Researchers working in data science might not have the neccesary training or knowledge to be able to consider all these possible cases, which is why the data hazard project was started in the first place.

So if you are working on a project using data science, take a minute to think which labels could apply to your project and encourage others to do the same to get a well rounded perspective on the possible outcomes!
